# Weather-Dashboard

# Description 
This is a five day weather forecast with the ability to store previous searches. It shows five day forecast of city's temperature, wind speed, and humidity. When you search for a city, it creates a button. It then saves that info to the localStorage so that when you click on that button, it displays the forecast for you again.
